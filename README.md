# TunePlay Streamer

[Download for Windows](https://github.com/FreekBes/tuneplay-streamer/raw/master/dist/tuneplay-streamer-latest.exe)

In order to be able to use this program, you'll need to have access to an artist using the [TunePlay Artist portal](https://www.tuneplay.net/portal.php). If you do not have access yet but do have an artist or band name under which you're releasing music, please contact support@tuneplay.net.

Upon pressing the "Start livestream" button, your computer might ask you if you allow a program named "liquidsoap.exe" access via your network and stuff. [Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) is used for the connection between your device and TunePlay. As such, it is required to allow this - otherwise you won't be able to stream using this application.
