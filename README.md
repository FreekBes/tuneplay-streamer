# DO NOT USE
Right now, this application is very unstable on TunePlay's end and may cause some serious problems for your artist profile. Do not use this application, but use [B.U.T.T.](https://danielnoethen.de/) instead.

We might try to resolve these issues in the future, but as TunePlay's livestreaming features aren't used that regularly, we won't be putting that much time into it right now. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

# TunePlay Streamer

[Download for Windows](https://github.com/FreekBes/tuneplay-streamer/raw/master/dist/tuneplay-streamer-latest.exe)

In order to be able to use this program, you'll need to have access to an artist using the [TunePlay Artist portal](https://www.tuneplay.net/portal.php). If you do not have access yet but do have an artist or band name under which you're releasing music, please contact support@tuneplay.net.

Upon pressing the "Start livestream" button, your computer might ask you if you allow a program named "liquidsoap.exe" access via your network and stuff. [Liquidsoap](https://www.liquidsoap.info/) is used for the connection between your device and TunePlay. As such, it is required to allow this - otherwise you won't be able to stream using this application.

**It is recommended to disable your antivirus while installing and/or using the TunePlay Streamer, since we do not have the money to pay a developing license for Windows, antivirus programs often see TunePlay as a threat.**
